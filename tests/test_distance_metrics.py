"""
Exercise: implement a series of tests with which you validate the
correctness (or lack thereof) of the function great_circle_distance.

The idea behind this exercise is to get you familiar with testing, so that when
you develop code, you can quickly iterate and check that what you're developing
matches the expectations.
